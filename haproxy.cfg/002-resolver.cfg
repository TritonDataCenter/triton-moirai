    # DNS payload size affects how many servers can realistically be on the
    # back end of our DNS queries. 1232 is the recommended size for avoiding
    # packet fragmentation and alows up to 88 A records. However, that's only
    # 7 SRV records. Even 8192 only allows for about 53 SRV records. That
    # should be sufficient for the vast majority of deployments. Above 8192
    # will lead to outright DNS failures unless it is known that the network
    # can support it.
    # The symptom of this being too low is "unspecified DNS error" in the
    # haproxy log when loglevel is set to debug. If that's you, we're sorry
    # you're here. You're probably also experiencing several other network
    # scaling limitations. The best option for you at this point is probably
    # to switch to A records rather than SRV records. Good luck, and May the
    # Force be with you.
